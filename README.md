# dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles managed with Nix and Home Manager.

## Setup

To set up these dotfiles on a new system, follow these steps:

1. Install Nix if it's not already installed on your system.

2. Install Home Manager.

3. Run


```
home-manager switch --flake ~/path/to/directory/containing/flake/
```
